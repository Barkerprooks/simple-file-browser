# Simple File Browser
A simple file storage and browser interface. Created using
_ReactJS_ and supported by a RESTful API implemented
with Python's _Flask_ framework.

# How to Use
Currently, due to time constraints, only the _Docker_ version of this 
project is supported. You can build it yourself using the provided 
build script, and then run it on http port `80` using:
```
docker run --rm -d -v <local dir>:/var/lib/nginx/html/public -p 80:80 gmfs
```
